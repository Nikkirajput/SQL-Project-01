Question:

You're working on a project where you need to generate a sales report that includes both total sales for
each product category and an overall total. Your database contains a table named Sales with the
following columns:

ProductCategory: The category of the product sold.
ProductName: The name of the product sold.
SaleAmount: The amount of the sale.
How would you use the SQL Server ROLLUP function to generate a report that shows the total sales for
each product category as well as the overall total sales?

Hint:

Consider using the ROLLUP function in conjunction with a GROUP BY clause to achieve the desired
results. You may need to carefully structure your query to ensure that it produces the correct subtotal
and grand total rows.

Sample Input:

Let's assume we have the following sample data in the Sales table:

ProductCategory ProductName SaleAmount
Electronics Laptop 1000

Electronics Phone 800
Electronics Tablet 500
Clothing Shirt 300
Clothing Pants 400
Furniture Sofa 1200
Furniture Bed 900

Expected Output:

The output should include total sales for each product category and an overall total. It would look like
this:

ProductCategory ProductName TotalSales
Clothing Pants 400.00
Clothing Shirt 300.00
Clothing Total 700.00
Electronics Laptop 1000.00
Electronics Phone 800.00
Electronics Tablet 500.00
Electronics Total 2300.00
Furniture Bed 900.00
Furniture Sofa 1200.00
Furniture Total 2100.00
Total Total 5100.00





SELECT
    ISNULL(ProductCategory, 'Total') AS ProductCategory,
    CASE 
        WHEN ProductCategory IS NOT NULL AND ProductName IS NULL THEN 'Total'
        WHEN ProductCategory IS NULL THEN 'Total'
        ELSE ProductName
    END AS ProductName,
    SUM(SaleAmount) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales
GROUP BY ROLLUP(ProductCategory, ProductName)
ORDER BY 
    GROUPING(ProductCategory), 
    ProductCategory,
    GROUPING(ProductName),
    ProductName;
